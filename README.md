# hangman
1 Project's Description:
- Responsive/adaptive UI from 1440px to 360px viewport;
- The game starts with the correct default view (empty gallows, underscores for secret word, etc.) and a random question;
- The user can play the game by using the virtual keyboard;
- The user can play the game by using the physical keyboard;
- When the letter is correct, it appears instead of the corresponding underscore. If the letter repeats in the word, all corresponding underscores must be replaced by it;
- When the letter is incorrect:
 - the incorrect guesses counter is updated;
 - a body part is added to the gallows;
- The clicked/pressed letter is disabled;
- The body parts appear on the gallows in the logical order (head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg);
- When the user runs out of 6 attempts or wins the game, the modal window appears;
- The modal window includes the message about the game's outcome (winning or losing), the secret word and the 'play again' button;
- When the user clicks the 'play again' button, the game starts over by showing a new question and resetting the gallows, the incorrect guesses counter and the underscores for the secret word;
